# In task_c.py write a program which:
# - Asks users to enter a password which should consist of letters and numbers only. Punctuation can 
password = input("Please enter a password: ")
# be ignored â€“ the tests will not check for punctuation handling.
# - Checks that the password is: 
# - A minimum of 8 characters long
# - Contains more than 1 type of character (not just letters, not just numbers)
# - If the password is valid print:
# Your password is valid
# - If the password is not valid print:
# Your password must contain at least 8 characters, and a mix of letters and numbers
# Hint: You will need to use Boolean operators and some basic string manipulation functions.
